## Overview 

The new documentation site for Ensime.

## Survey of features

Some of the more prominent features of this theme include the following:

* Bootstrap framework
* Sidebar for table of contents
* Top navigation bar with drop-down menus
* PDF generation (through Prince XML utility)
* Build scripts to automate the workflow
* Notes, tips, and warning information notes
* A nifty system for creating links to different pages
* Tags for alternative nativation
* Content sharing across projects
* Emphasis on pages, not posts
* Relative (rather than absolute) link structure, so you can push the outputs anywhere and easily view them

I'm using this theme for my documentation projects, building about 20 different outputs for various products, versions, languages, and audiences from the same set of files. This single sourcing requirement has influenced how I constructed this theme.
