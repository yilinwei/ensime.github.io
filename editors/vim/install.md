You will need a version of Vim built with Python plugin support. This is standard on most distribution packages these days. Try `vim --version | grep +python` to confirm.

1. Install external Python modules that `ensime-vim` requires to function:

    ```bash
    $ pip install websocket-client sexpdata
    ```
1. If you use NeoVim, additionally ensure you've installed the `neovim` module:

   ```bash
   $ pip install neovim
   ```
1. Install `ensime-sbt` as a global sbt plugin. This will automatically create the `.ensime` config file for a project.

   ```
    $ echo 'addSbtPlugin("org.ensime" % "ensime-sbt" % "0.3.3")' >> ~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/plugins.sbt
   ```
1. Add ensime-vim to your plugin manager of choice in your `.vimrc` (or `init.vim` for NeoVim):

    Plugin Manager                                    | Your .{n}vimrc
    --------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------
    [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)  | `Plug 'ensime/ensime-vim'`
    [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) | `Plugin 'ensime/ensime-vim'`
    
   Under the hood this is just another Vim plugin, so other plugin managers should work great as well.
1. Install the [vim-scala] plugin for Scala filetype detection and highlighting. Optionally, install [Syntastic] as well for syntax checking integrated with ENSIME. Instructions for both plugins can be found in their respective documentation.
1. Trigger the plugin installations after updating your configuration. With `vim-plug` this is done by executing `:PlugInstall`. With `Vundle` run `:PluginInstall`. For NeoVim, you must finally run `:UpdateRemotePlugins` after the installation.

##### Post-Install Config

Depending on your preferences, you may want to add some of the following to your `.vimrc`

 - Typechecking after writing

    ```
    autocmd BufWritePost *.scala :EnTypeCheck
    ```
 - Easy Type Inspection

    ```
    nnoremap <localleader>t :EnTypeCheck<CR>
    ```
 - Customize the browser used for `:EnDocBrowse` by setting an environment variable, in your shell initialization

    ```bash
    $ export BROWSER="firefox %s"
    ```

   By default the plugin tries to make a good guess for your platform (see the Python [webbrowser module] for details). You can also [point the variable to a script][browser-script] for something fancier.
