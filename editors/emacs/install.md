## System requirements

- JDK 1.6+
- Emacs 24.3+
- Scala 2.10.4+ or 2.11.5+


## Installing

We assume that you already have [MELPA](http://melpa.org) set up as per our [Learning Emacs](/editors/emacs/learning) guide.

The recommended way to install ENSIME is via MELPA and registering a `scala-mode-hook`:

```elisp
(use-package ensime
  :commands ensime ensime-mode)

(add-hook 'scala-mode-hook 'ensime-mode)
```

For the server installation to work, make sure `sbt` is in your `PATH` environment. 

On OSX, set `exec-path` within Emacs, e.g.:

```elisp
(setq exec-path (append exec-path '("/usr/local/bin")))
```

On Windows, you need to add an extra command line parameter to `sbt`:

```elisp
(setenv "SBT_OPTS" (concat (getenv "SBT_OPTS") " -Djline.terminal=jline.UnsupportedTerminal" ) ) 
```

Basic Scala support is provided by [`scala-mode2`](/editors/emacs/scala-mode) which provides many features specific to Scala major mode editing and sbt support is provided by [`sbt-mode`](/editors/emacs/sbt-mode). Both modes can be used independently of ENSIME and your are encouraged to read their standalone documentation to understand the role that they play.


## Updating

ENSIME uses a continuous release and the developers assume that you are staying up to date with releases.

The server will be automatically upgraded when you upgrade the client, which will result in a short `*ensime-update*` session. You can manually force a server update by typing:

```
M-x ensime-server-update
```


## Starting

Compile your project with your [build tool](/build_tools) and generate a `.ensime` file. Then navigate to a file or directory in your project and type:

```
M-x ensime
```

**Check that again**. It is very important that you compile your project and have generated a `.ensime` file from one of the supported build tools.

The first time you use ENSIME, you can expect to wait several minutes for the server and all of its dependencies to be downloaded.

On first use for a project, you will need to wait a few moments for indexing to complete.

Once the server is available, enjoy editing with the ENSIME commands that are documented in the [User Guide](/editors/emacs/userguide) and consider using some of the suggestions in our [Hacks](/editors/emacs/hacks) page to improve your productivity in Emacs when editing Scala code.
