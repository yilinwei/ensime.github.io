This mode can be used independently of ENSIME.

The mode intends to provide basic emacs support for the Scala language, including

- local indenting of code, comments and multi-line strings
- motion commands
- highlighting

- TOC
{:toc}

## Installation

This mode will be installed automatically if you use ENSIME.

However, if you want to install separately, the preferred mechanism is via MELPA and `use-package` as per our [Learning Emacs](/editors/emacs/learning) guide:

```elisp
(use-package scala-mode2
  :interpreter
  ("scala" . scala-mode))
```

## Multi-line comments

The start of a multi-line comment is indented to the same level with code.

By default, if a multi-line comment begins with `/*` it is considered to be a Scaladoc comment. Scaladoc comments are indented according to the Scaladoc style guide.

```scala
/** This is a Scaladoc comment.
  * 2nd line.
  */
```

Alternatively, if the configurable variable *scala-indent:use-javadoc-style* is set to `t`, multi-line comments beginning with `/**` will be indented according to the Javadoc style, wherein all following lines are indented under the first asterisk.

```scala
/**
 * This is a Javadoc-style comment.
 * 2nd line.
 */
```

All other multi-line comments are indented under the first asterisk.

```
/**
 * Supercalifragilistic-
 * expialidocious!
 */

/*
 A comment
 */
```

Typing an asterisk in multi-line comment region, at the start of a line, will trigger indent. Furthermore, if the configurable variable `scala-indent:add-space-for-scaladoc-asterisk` is `t` (default) and the asterisk was the last character on the line, a space will be inserted after it. If you type a forward slash after the automatically inserted space, the space is deleted again so that you can end the comment without deleting the space manually.


## Filling (i.e. word wrap)

Paragraph `filling` is supported for comments and multi-line strings. Auto-fill is not supported yet.

To re-fill a paragraph, use the `fill-paragraph` command ( `M-q` ). As always, the column at which to wrap is controlled by the `fill-column` variable, which you set it with the `set-fill-column` command. To set the default, you use the `customize-variable` command or a mode-hook.


## Motion

Emacs commands `forward-sexp` and `backward-sexp` ( `M-C-f`, `M-C-b` ) motion commands will move over reserved words, literals, ids and lists.

Text paragraph motion (i.e. `forward-paragraph`, `backward-paragraph`) works inside comments and multi-line strings, and it respect Scaladoc's wiki-style markup.

`scala-syntax:beginning-of-definition` and `scala-syntax:end-of-definition` move the cursor forward and backward over class, trait, object, def, val, var, and type definitions. These functions are assigned to the buffer local variables `beginning-of-defun-function` and `end-of-defun-function` which makes it so that the `beginning-of-defun` and `end-of-defun` functions behave in a way that is appropriate to scala. These functions are not currently able to support some of the more advanced scala definition types.


## Highlighting

The highlighting of variable definitions, such as

```var test = "some mutable variable"```

now result in the variable name ("test" above) to be highlighted using the variable scala-font-lock:var-face. Per default, the value of scala-font-lock:var-face is 'font-lock-warning-face. You can always change the highlighting of vars by changing scala-font-lock:var-face through the Emacs face customization (use `M-x` *customize-face*).

Very complex scala files may need the following in your emacs init (.emacs, etc):

```lisp
;; For complex scala files
(setq max-lisp-eval-depth 50000)
(setq max-specpdl-size 5000)
```

## imenu

ENSIME users have access to the compiler's summary of the file and this `scala-mode` functionality is overridden.

scala-mode2 supports imenu, a library for accessing locations in documents that is included in emacs 24. The custom variable `scala-imenu:should-flatten-index` controls whether or not the imenu index will be hierarchical or completely flat. The current iMenu implementation only goes one level deep i.e. nested classes are not traversed. scala-mode2's imenu support depends heavily on the `scala-syntax:end-of-definition` and `scala-syntax:beginning-of-definition` functions, and as such, it shares their limitations.

## Joinin lines (delete indentation) and removing horizontal whitespace

Scala-mode defines its own `scala-indent:join-line` and `scala-indent:fixup-whitespace` functions.

Unlike the normal `join-line` (aka `delete-indentation`), `scala-indent:join-line` detects the comment fill-prefix and removes it.

The `scala-indent:fixup-whitespace` first removes all horizontal whitespace, then adds one space the context requires none to be present (before semicolon, around dot, after `(` or `[`, before `)` or `]`, etc).

## Indenting

**Where four developers meet, there are four opinions on how code should be indented**.

`scala-mode` supports 2^4 different ways of applying local heuristics to indentation.

Note that when used with ENSIME or `sbt-scalariform`, your local indentation rules will be overwritten.

### Run-on lines

Provided by `scala-indent:default-run-on-strategy`

The indenting engine has three modes for handling run-on lines. The `reluctant` (default) mode is geared toward a general style of coding and the `eager` for strictly functional style. A third mode called `operators` is between the two.

The difference between the modes is how they treat run-on lines. For example, the `eager` mode will indent `map` in the following code

```scala
val x = List(1, 2, 3)
  map(x => x + 1)
```

The `operators` and `eager` modes will indent the second row in the following code, as the first line ends with an operator character.

```scala
val x = 20 +
  21
```

The `reluctant` mode (default) will not indent the line in either case. However, all three modes will indent the second line in these examples as it is clear that the first line cannot terminate a statement.

```scala
val x = List(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
  map (x => x + 1) // last token of previous line cannot terminate a statement

val y = (List(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
           map (x => x + 1)) // inside 'newlines disabled' region
```

You can use empty lines in the `eager` mode to stop it from indenting a line. For example

```scala
val x = foo("bar")
           ("zot", "kala") // indented as curry

val y = foo("bar")

("zot", "kala") // a tuple
```

However, in all three modes pressing the `tab` key repeatedly on a line will toggle between the modes.

### Value expressions

Provided by `scala-indent:indent-value-expression`

When this variable is set to *nil* (default), body of a value expressions will be indented in the traditional way.

```scala
val x = try {
  some()
} catch {
  case e => other
} finally {
  clean-up()
}
```

However, when the variable is set to `t`, the body will be indented one extra step to make the `val`, `var` or `def` stand out. For example:

```scala
val x = try {
    some()
  } catch {
    case e => other
  } finally {
    clean-up()
  }
```

### Parameter lists

Provided by `scala-indent:align-parameters`

When this variable is set to `nil` (default), parameters and run-on lines in parameter lists will not align under or acording to the first parameter.

```scala
val y = List( "Alpha", "Bravo",
  "Charlie" )

val x = equals(List(1,2,3) map (x =>
  x + 1))
```

When the variable is set to `t`, the same will be indented as:

```scala
val y = List( "Alpha", "Bravo",
              "Charlie" )

val x = equals(List(1,2,3) map (x =>
                 x + 1))
```

### Expression forms: if, for, try

Provided by `scala-indent:align-forms`

When this variable is set to `nil` (default), `if`, `for` and `try` forms are not aligned specially.

```scala
val x = if (kala)
  foo
else if (koira)
  bar
else
  zot

val x = try "1".toInt
catch { case e => 0}
finally { println("hello") }

val xs = for (i <- 1 to 10)
yield i
```

When the variable is set to `t`, the same will be indented as:

```scala
val x = if (kala)
          foo
        else if (koira)
          bar
        else
          zot

val x = try "1".toInt
        catch { case e => 0}
        finally { println("hello") }

val xs = for (i <- 1 to 10)
         yield i
```
