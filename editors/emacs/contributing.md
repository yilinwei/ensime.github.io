## Emacs Lisp

The [GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/elisp.html) is a very enjoyable read and will prepare you for everything you need to contribute to any Emacs package.

We have some suggested [hacks for Emacs Lisp](/editors/emacs/hacks#emacs-lisp) that you may enjoy.

If you want a playground to exercise your newly found Emacs Lisp muscles, consider forking @fommil's [port of 99 problems](https://github.com/fommil/e99) and re-implementing the answers.

## Setup

First, clone the git repo hosted at [github.com/ensime/ensime-emacs](https://github.com/ensime/ensime-emacs). If you pick up a ticket, please comment on it to let us know so that we can help (and also to avoid overlapping with somebody else). Feel free to ask questions on the github issue tracker or [gitter.im/ensime/ensime-emacs](https://gitter.im/ensime/ensime-emacs).

The `.drone.yml` describes what our CI does and this can be followed for your local development.

You must install [Cask](http://cask.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide/installation.html), the excellent build tool for Emacs Lisp projects and then initialise the repository and install the dependencies with:

```
cask pkg-file
cask install
```

## Testing

It all starts with a test.

The old tests are in `ensime-tests.el` but [we want to migrate](https://github.com/ensime/ensime-emacs/issues/389) to use [ert](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/ert.html) (see `test/ensime-emacs-test.el`) and [ecukes](https://github.com/ecukes/ecukes) (see the `features` directory).

To run the old tests, run the hacky `test/run_emacs_tests.sh` script.

To run the new, preferred style, tests, type `cask exec ert-runner` and `cask exec ecukes`.


## Manual QA

Please run your branch to hack on Scala code (our QA testing phase), add your local explicitly into your `~/.emacs.d/init.el` and restart Emacs.

```elisp
;; assuming you put the repository in ~/.emacs.d/ensime-emacs
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "ensime-emacs" user-emacs-directory))
```
