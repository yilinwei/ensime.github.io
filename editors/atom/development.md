## Working with the Atom ENSIME Source

The basic cycle for interactive hacking on Atom ENSIME is: checkout the project (or a fork), install the package from your fork. Then: make edits, re-load Atom, repeat. Feel free to chat on gitter, and send a pull request.

In detail:

- Checkout the project from: https://github.com/ensime/ensime-atom

- Either checkout straight into _.atom/packages_ (or `ln -s` from there to your checkout). You need to have the right name on the folder: "Ensime".

- From that directory run: `apm install`.

- In Atom: "Window: reload" (ctrl-option-cmd l) to reload plugin from source while developing.  Then start ENSIME in Atom as usual.

- View / Developer / Toggle Developer Tools gives you the usual console and other inspectors.


### Developing ensime-client node package in parallel

When developing ensime-atom, chances are high you will most likely need to develop the node package [ensime-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ensime-client) in parallel. This npm package was recently pulled out from ensime-atom to be a shared client lib for the node environment to use both in ensime-atom and a planned ensime-vscode.

To make the development smooth you will probably want to follow similar instructions as these:

https://atom.io/docs/latest/behind-atom-developing-node-modules

Specific example of these follow.

Notice that as part of pulling these things out, the ensime-client is no longer depending on Atom's automatic compilation of coffeescript. It instead uses grunt to compile the coffescript into js that is exported. Therefore you'll need to set up a watch task as well.

- `git clone https://github.com/hedefalk/ensime-node`
- `cd ensime-node`
- `npm install`
- `npm link` (this creates a softlink from npm registry to this working directory)
- `apm rebuild` (atom special sauce)
- `npm run watch` (alias for grunt watch, but might replace for gulp) 

On the ensime-atom side:
- `cd ensime-atom`
- `npm link ensime-client` (this create a softlink from node_modules to the npm registry)

The npm link business is basically just this:
```
/Users/viktor/dev/projects/atom-ensime/node_modules/ensime-client -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/ensime-client -> /Users/viktor/dev/projects/ensime-node
```

where `ensime-node` is my checked out git repo.


### Use server assembly jars

**Requires `ensime-sbt` 0.3.0 or later.**

If an `-assembly.jar` file exists in your `.atom/packages/Ensime` directory (for the expected binary version of scala and ENSIME) then it will always be used in preference to the `coursier` auto-update procedure.

This is advantageous for developing on ENSIME and also to enable a simple install of the ENSIME server in restricted environments. SNAPSHOT assembly jars are provided at http://ensime.typelevel.org/ (with many thanks to typelevel for the use of their servers).

To build your own server jars, do this:

```
git clone https://github.com/ensime/ensime-server.git
sbt ++2.11.7 ensime/assembly # replace with your version of scala
ln -s target/scala-2.11/ensime_2.11-0.9.10-SNAPSHOT-assembly.jar ~/.atom/packages/Ensime
```

When you want to swap back to using official releases, delete your `-assembly.jar` files.


## Tricks and tips

### Access ENSIME from the console

In the developer console, you can look up the package like this:

```
e = atom.packages.getActivePackage('Ensime').mainModule
```

From there you can access other parts of the package. E.g.,

```
client = e.clientOfEditor(atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor())
```
